				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					The Density Atlas was developed by a team of MIT faculty, students, and affiliated planners, architects and designers. The concept of combining the three commonly used measures of density to better understand and compare city blocks and neighborhoods emerged from a series of urban design classes which looked at housing development projects in both the United States and China.
