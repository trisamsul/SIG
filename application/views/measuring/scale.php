				<h2>Scale Measuring</h2>
				<p>
					The term "scale" has many meanings, but the in the Density Atlas, scale refers to the extent of land being measured. The Density Atlas defines five levels of scale in a typical metropolitan region.
					<br/><br/>
					There is no universal definition for “block” or “neighborhood” or “district.” Comparisons become especially difficult when looking at projects in different geographic contexts. 
					For example, a neighborhood in the South End of Boston takes a very different physical form than a neighborhood in a new planned community in Shenzhen, China, such as Wonderland.  On the surface, meaningful comparison seems unlikely because these “neighborhoods” look very different from each other.
					<br/><br/>
					However, the Density Atlas establishes criteria to enable appropriate comparisons among seemingly different developments, as described in other pages.
					<br/><br/>
					Density Atlas case studies focus on two scales: A (block or development parcel) and B (neighborhood). Additionally, each case may also describe characteristics of the larger planning district, city, or regional context.

Note that the FAR is typically higher at Level A than Level B, as there is less non-residential space required for smaller sites.
